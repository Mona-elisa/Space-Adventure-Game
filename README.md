# Space-Adventure-Game
Description:

Space Adventure Game is an interactive Scratch project where players control a spaceship to navigate through space, avoiding obstacles and collecting stars. The game starts with an engaging start screen, controlled by a robot sprite, and transitions into the main game where the player pilots a rocket sprite. The objective is to collect as many stars as possible while avoiding bats and beetles. Upon collision with a bat, the game ends, and the end screen is displayed.
Features:

    Start Screen: The game begins with a robot sprite prompting the player to press the space key to start the game.
    Spaceship Movement: Players can control the rocket sprite using the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.
    Cloning Mechanism: The game includes stars, bats, and beetles that are cloned to populate the game space, providing obstacles and collectibles.
    End Screen: If the spaceship collides with a bat, the game ends and the end screen, featuring a bat sprite, is displayed.
    Custom Block: A custom block is used to create clones of stars, bats, and beetles, making the game setup modular and scalable.

Technical Requirements Fulfilled:

    Sprites: At least two sprites are used, including a non-cat sprite (robot, rocket, bat, star, beetle).
    Scripts: More than three scripts are used in total.
    Conditionals: Conditional statements are used to check for key presses and collisions.
    Loops: Loops are used for continuously checking key presses and creating clones.
    Variable: Variables can be used to keep track of the score or other game states (e.g., number of stars collected).
    Custom Block: A custom block is created to handle the game setup, taking inputs for the number of clones for each sprite.

How to Play:

    Start the Game: When the green flag is clicked, the robot sprite appears, prompting the player to press the space key.
    Control the Spaceship: Use the arrow keys to move the rocket sprite around the screen.
    Collect Stars: Navigate the spaceship to collect stars while avoiding bats and beetles.
    End the Game: If the spaceship collides with a bat, the game ends and the end screen is displayed.
